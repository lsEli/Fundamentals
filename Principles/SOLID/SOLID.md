# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one and well defined responsibility.

## Open-Closed Principle

Open for extensions, closed for modifications. You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

## Interface Segregation Principle

Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. The high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
